1. Go to https://cloudpebble.net/ide/
2. Create a new Project, choose Pebble.js as your project type
3. Copy/Paste the code from src/app.js in this repo into your newly create app.js file
4. Make sure that your pebble is paired with your phone, and that both your phone anc computer are on the same wifi connection.
5. Click the blue play button which should be somewhere on the upper right hand side of the cloud pebble IDE
6. Play poppit!

NOTE: If you're having trouble creating a new project (ie. getting the infinite blue loading bar of death), try the identical ide at this address instead https://morning-shore-3240.herokuapp.com/ide

How to Play:

1. Have you ever played Bop-it? It's a lot like Bop-it.
2. Once you open the game you'll be greated with 1 of four instruction [up, select, down, tap]
3. [up, select, down] correspond to the buttons on the right side of your pebble if you are wearing it on your left wrist facing up.
4. [tap] means tap it! (Or slap it, or flick it, or hit it . . . just get that accelerometer moving!)
5. The lines on the bottom of the screen represent the time you have left.
6. A good score is anything over 20.
7. Thanks for playing!

NOTE: poppit runs on your phone and communicates with your watch over bluetooth. You may experience lag, please forgive me. If it totally stops working or says to open up your pebble watch, try shutting both your phone and pebble off and then restarting and repairing them. After a time out, your devices will play together nicely again.

CURRENT HIGH SCORE OF ALL TIME: 32
